BitLab is an interactive command-line tool for exploring and interacting with the Bitcoin P2P network and blockchain. Inspired by SockLab, BitLab provides a user-friendly interface for learning and working with Bitcoin's peer-to-peer networking protocols without needing to write low-level C code. The tool allows users to perform a wide range of operations on the Bitcoin network, such as peer discovery, connecting to peers, sending messages, and retrieving blockchain data.

BitLab acts as a powerful educational resource and debugging tool for understanding how Bitcoin nodes communicate, synchronize blocks, and process transactions.
